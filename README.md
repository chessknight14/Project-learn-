# Project-learn-
C++ text adventure: Registration, Calculator, and guessing game
<br>
<h1> Project "learning" </h1>

<h2> What is This </h2>
<p> It's file from last year I kept up with while learning bits of C++ day by day, or week. Just 3 text adventures in one. Unprofessional variable names and comments because I was just having fun. </p>

<h2> Details </h2>
<p> The beginning tells you what to press, and there's a calculator to do basic add, sub, multiply, or div with two numbers, or you can press X to add info.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p><b> Made with:</b> VS Code </p>
<p><b>Time it took:</b> Probably a month or two, since I'd update it every time I learned a new thing. </p>
<br>
<h5> I'll be making an updated, better calculator soon since I'm getting into learning C++. </h5>
